<p class="intro"><b>
It is a common book lending and borrowing platform within college students.
<br />
We at "Share It Right" pay lenders some amount to attract famous reference books and lend these books to all the borrowers at least prices available anywhere within the market.
<br />
Started in February 2022 by three RV college students of ECE branch as an attempt to bridge the gap between students who need very affordable and famous book options trying to avoid library fines and fuss of returning in time  and students who have piles of famous books wasted and end up giving them away for weighing without satisfaction of lending them in right hand.
